        Painstakingly researched, <em>From Railyards to High-Rises</em> uncovers the buried history of a unique part of Chicago.  
        Craig Hutson unveils how it was transformed from lake into land into railyards, and, finally, into an urban high-rise enclave.
    </p>
    <p>
        The railroad, the city, and the state battled over ownership of land, water, and air. Bold developers tried to bring their grand visions to life while navigating credit crunches, recessions, a depression, a pandemic, and even radioactive material. Politicians looked to build a great city but wrestled amongst themselves and with their citizens, who fought for their voice, rights, and space. Meanwhile, architects either designed the tried and true or took daring leaps in their creations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Craig Hutson chronicles the story of lakefront land that was literally shaped and molded by the Illinois Central Railroad. He shows how it evolved into Chicago’s Illinois Center, the New East Side, and Lakeshore East. It’s a story driven by the earliest settlers, the railroad, the city of Chicago, and by audacious developers, architects, and community advocates.
    </p>
<p> A rare story untold until now, <em>From Railyards to High-Rises</em> collects over two centuries’ worth of history, using thousands of sources, including newspaper articles, insightful interviews, legal documents, and more, to tell a story for history buffs, Chicago residents, and visitors alike.</p>
